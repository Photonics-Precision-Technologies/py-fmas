'py-fmas' python package
========================

The `py-fmas` python package solves for the :math:`z`-propagation dynamics of
spectrally broad ultrashort optical pulses in single mode nonlinear waveguides
in terms of a nonlinear unidirectional propagation model for the analytic
signal of the optical field.  It allows to model propagation scenarios with and
without the Raman effect.

   Interaction between a fundamental soliton and a dispersive wave in a
   NL-PM-750 photonic crystal fiber (PCF).  Propagation charactersitics of the
   analytic signal intensities in the time-domain (left) and the frequency
   domain (right).  For the numerical simualtion the forward model for the
   analytic signal including the Raman effect is used. More details can be
   found in the usage example 
   :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_gallery_01_g_specialized_model_NLPM.py`.

For a user-specified propagation setting, the initial real-valued optical field
is defined on a periodic one-dimensional temporal grid and converted to the
complex-valued analytic signal for the optical field.  :math:`z`-propagation is
performed by pseudospectral methods. 
The provided software implements a selection of algorithms that are commonly
used in nonlinear optics for solving nonlinear Schrödinger type equations.
`py-fmas` implements algorithms with both, fixed or adaptive stepsize.

The provided software allows for the propagation of spectrally broad ultrashort
optical pulses and several pulses at pairwise distinct frequencies.
Description of the proapgation process in terms of the analytic signal allows
to directly neglect non-resonant contributions of four-wave mixing and to
derive models that are formally simpler that the forward Maxwell equation.  The
range of applicability of the software is however equivalent to that of the
forward Maxwell equation.
If the Raman effect is neglected and a slowly varying envelope approximation is
applied, the considered propagation model can be reduced to the standard
nonlinear Schrödinger equation.
For reasonably chosen initial conditions, the provided software can be used
beyond the unidirectional approximation as a bidirectional model for a complex
field, allowing to describe forward and backward waves coupled through
nonlinear interactions (see the useage example 
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_gallery_03_g_BMCF.py`). 

`py-fmas` is based on our research code and was implemented with the aim of beeing
easily extendible and maintainable. The provided software is aimed at researchers
in the field of ultrashort pulse propagation and related disciplines.

The source code of the package is available on `gitHub`_.
